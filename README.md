# Hospitality-Analysis-Project
This Project is about Hotel Booking Data using MySQL and Power BI
# Problem Statement:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
# Tools and Technologies:
- **MySQL**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing the data insights.
